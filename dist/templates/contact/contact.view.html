I come from an engineering family. My father is a radio-frequency engineer, and my brother was an electrical engineer and software developer so I've always known that I have a very technical side to me. It is because of this, that I was able to find my passion in becoming a developer.</p><p>When I was younger, I always wanted to be an animator for Disney. I enjoyed drawing all the different characters growing up, but I eventually found myself drawn more towards technical drawings. Upon entering college at The Ohio State University, I chose to study architecture. I enjoyed architecture and studied it for a year, but I knew it wasn't the perfect fit for me. The next quarter I took a class on Photoshop, and one on Flash, and I instantly knew that I had found the passion that I needed to motivate and drive me.</p><p>I am currently enjoying working on the UX team for IgnitionOne in Akron, Ohio where I am responsible for improving the user experience of our software platform. The first 4 years, I was a part of the professional services department where I worked often with designing mobile experiences and desktop microsites for our clients. I've been blessed to find such a good situation working there where there have been numerous opportunities for me to grow as a designer and full-stack developer. I married a great wife, Lauren, in April 2011 and we have a dog named Nala. My passion for sports is almost as great as my passion for web design. I enjoy playing volleyball, basketball, and baseball. If I'm not in front of a computer working hard, I'm either with Lauren or playing some type of sport.</p></div></div><div class="secondary"><h2>Connect With Me</h2><div class="social"><a href="http://twitter.com/mattcsloan" class="btn btn-icon"><i class="icon icon-social-twitter"></i><span class="tooltip">Twitter</span></a><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/mattcsloan" class="btn btn-icon"><i class="icon icon-social-linkedin"></i><span class="tooltip">LinkedIn</span></a><a href="http://github.com/mattcsloan/" class="btn btn-icon"><i class="icon icon-social-github"></i><span class="tooltip">GitHub</span></a><a href="https://dribbble.com/sloan" class="btn btn-icon"><i class="icon icon-social-dribbble"></i><span class="tooltip">Dribbble</span></a><a href="http://www.facebook.com/mattcsloan" class="btn btn-icon"><i class="icon icon-social-facebook"></i><span class="tooltip">Facebook</span></a><a href="https://plus.google.com/115025935820609770656/" class="btn btn-icon"><i class="icon icon-social-google-plus"></i><span class="tooltip">Google+</span></a></div><div class="workload_content"><h2>Current Availability</h2><p>I have a steady workload right now, but am finishing up a few projects and am looking to pick up something new.
