I come from an engineering family. My father is a radio-frequency engineer, and my brother was an electrical engineer and software developer so I've always known that I have a very technical side to me. It is because of this, that I was able to find my passion in becoming a developer.</p><p>When I was younger, I always wanted to be an animator for Disney. I enjoyed drawing all the different characters growing up, but I eventually found myself drawn more towards technical drawings. Upon entering college at The Ohio State University, I chose to study architecture. I enjoyed architecture and studied it for a year, but I knew it wasn't the perfect fit for me. The next quarter I took a class on Photoshop, and one on Flash, and I instantly knew that I had found the passion that I needed to motivate and drive me.</p><p>I am currently enjoying working on the UX team for IgnitionOne in Akron, Ohio where I am responsible for improving the user experience of our software platform. The first 4 years, I was a part of the professional services department where I worked often with designing mobile experiences and desktop microsites for our clients. I've been blessed to find such a good situation working there where there have been numerous opportunities for me to grow as a designer and full-stack developer. I married a great wife, Lauren, in April 2011 and we have a dog named Nala. My passion for sports is almost as great as my passion for web design. I enjoy playing volleyball, basketball, and baseball. If I'm not in front of a computer working hard, I'm either with Lauren or playing some type of sport.</p></div></div>
